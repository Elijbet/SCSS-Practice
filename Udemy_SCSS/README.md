# SCSS-Practice

### Project Roadmap

* setting up config to get css build in a proper folder in our setup
* defining variables and using them: having variables clustered on top gives overview of the css and so is good for organization
* partials are created to compartmentalize code; these need to be superceded with a _ so that it won't get converted to css; configure sublime on save build for this. Import the Variables into main.scss file
* mixins allow to create reusable styles: can be applied generally, inside of styles, as well inside of other mixins
